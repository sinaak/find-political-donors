Coding Challenge for insight data engineering

I didn't add any packages

You can run this project with the command ./run.sh  give the input from input folder --> itcont.txt and get the output in output folder

As I thought your test case in medianvals_by_date.txt has a typo in first line : C00177436|01312017|384|4|1382 because   1382/4 is not 384 and it is 346

I changed the test case medianvals_by_date.txt and fix that typo
