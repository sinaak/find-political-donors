Coding Challenge for insight data engineering:

I have not added any packages.

The code can be run using the ./run.sh  command.

Input should be given in the “input” folder. Get the output in the “output” folder.

I believe that the test case medianvals_by_date.txt has a typo in its first line: C00177436|01312017|384|4|1382 

1382/4 is not equal to 384 but 346

So I changed the test case medianvals_by_date.txt and fixed the typo.
